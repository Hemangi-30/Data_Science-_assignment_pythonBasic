        "\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python use hashing to quickly access values associated with keys. The hash value of a key is computed based on its contents. If a key were mutable (i.e., its contents could change), the hash value might change after the key is added to the dictionary. This would disrupt the dictionary's internal organization and could lead to unpredictable behavior or errors.\n",
